                    - `start`  
                      Starts (or restarts) the recurring invoice. **note** if the recurring invoice has been stopped for a long time, it will attempt to catch back up firing a new Invoice every hour per interval that has been missed.  
                      If you do not wish to have the recurring invoice catch up, you should set the next_send_date to the correct date you wish the recurring invoice to commence from.
                    - `stop`  
                      Stops the recurring invoice. 
                    - `send_now`  
                      Force sends the recurring invoice - this option is only available when the recurring invoice is in a draft state.  
                    - `restore`  
                      Restores the recurring invoice from an archived or deleted state.
                    - `archive`  
                      Archives the recurring invoice. The recurring invoice will not fire in this state.
                    - `delete`  
                      Deletes a recurring invoice.
